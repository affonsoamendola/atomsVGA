# Fofonso's Atoms VGA

A clone of a cool 90s little puzzle game I found on a shareware disk for Windows 3.11 called Atoms, made by Mike McNamee.

My version runs natively in MS-DOS 6.22 (Should run fine on earlier versions as long as you use a VGA board), that does mean you'll have to use DosBox or other emulators to play it, I dont think I'll make a modern OS version, because I dont really care enough :P.

Written in C and compiled with Borland's Turbo C++, as usual for my DOS projects.

The release folder contains a precompiled executable that runs fine on DOSBox 0.74, I also included a .conf file and a Windows lnk file, If you have no clue how to use DOSBox, just download it and drop the DOSBox.exe, SDL.dll and SDL_net.dll on the same folder as the game and double click on the AtomsVGA shortcut on there, should run just fine.

Uses FFLIBVGA and FFLIBEGA, so check them out if you're interested in old graphics stuff.

Distributed under GPLv3, check LICENSE and all that good jazz.
