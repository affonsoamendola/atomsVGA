# Fofonso's Atoms VGA

A clone of a cool 90s little puzzle game I found on a shareware disk for Windows 3.11 called Atoms, made by Mike McNamee.

My version runs natively in MS-DOS 6.22 (Should run fine on earlier versions as long as you use a VGA board), that does mean you'll have to use DosBox or other emulators to play it, I dont think I'll make a modern OS version, because I dont really care enough :P.

Written in C and compiled with Borland's Turbo C++, as usual for my DOS projects.

Distributed under GPLv3, check LICENSE and all that good jazz.
